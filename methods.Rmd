We explored a variety of [autoregressive (AR) models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) in different configurations and with different numbers of AR terms with the following exclusions/inclusions:

- [moving average (MA) component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving-average_model)
- **random intercepts**:
  - month as the random intercept (total of 12)
  - day of the year as the random intercept (total of 365)
- days of the week as predictor variables in the regression component (as dummy variables)
- **models of intervention impact** $\delta_0$ at time $T$:
  - immediate, constant change $z_t = \delta_0 I_t$
  - gradually levelling-off change: $z_t = \omega_1 z_{t-1} + \delta_0 I_t$
  - ramping-up, then gradually levelling-off ("S"-shaped) [Gompertz function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function) change: $z_t = \delta_0 \mathrm{e}^{-d \mathrm{e}^{-\lambda (t - T)}} I_t$

with indicator $I_t = 1$ for $t >= T$ and $I_t = 0$ otherwise in all cases. The $I_t$ is to ensure $z_t = 0$ when $t < T$. It may be helpful to visualize those three possible models of change-due-to-intervention. Suppose the observed data covers 20 days and that the intervention occurred on day 5:

```{r dataviz_change_comparison, fig.width=12, fig.height=4, fig.pos="h", out.extra = "", fig.cap="These three models show how the same intervention effect may express itself in multiple ways."}
c(N, T, delta0, omega1, lambda, d) %<-% c(20, 5, 1, 0.6, 0.5, 7)
z <- dplyr::bind_rows(list(
  A = data.frame(t = T:N, z = (delta0 / (1 - omega1))),
  B = data.frame(t = T:N, z = delta0 * (1 - (omega1 ^ ((T:N) - T + 1))) / (1 - omega1)),
  C = data.frame(t = T:N, z = (delta0 / (1 - omega1)) * exp(-d * exp(-lambda * ((T:N) - T))))
), .id = "change model") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(`change model` = factor(`change model`, c("A", "B", "C"), c("instant, constant", "gradually levelling-off", "Gompertz")))
ggplot(z, aes(x = t, y = z)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = T, linetype = "dashed") +
  facet_wrap(~ `change model`, ncol = 3) +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(t = 1:T, z = 0), color = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, (delta0 / (1 - omega1)) + 1)) +
  labs(
    y = expression(z[t]), x = "t", color = "Change applied to time series",
    title = expression("Models of change-due-to-intervention"~z[t]~at~T==10)
  ) +
  wmf::theme_facet(
    14, axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )
```

All modeling was done with the [Stan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(software)) probabilistic programming language [@JSSv076i01] and fit in the statistical software and programming language [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) [@base] using the **RStan** interface [@rstan] and [Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo).

For model comparison, we used **bridgesampling** R package by Gronau et al. [-@2017arXiv171008162G] to calculate the log marginal likelihood and posterior probability of each model. Then we used the same package to calculate the Bayes factor of the top candidates and interpreted it within the Kass and Raftery framework [-@doi:10.1080/01621459.1995.10476572] to select the best one. Those models and their metrics are listed in Table 3 in the Appendix.

The final, hierarchical model of daily search engine-referred desktop traffic $y_t$ (measured as millions of pageviews) is ARMA(2,1) with day-of-year random intercepts $\alpha_d$, Normally-distributed noise $\epsilon_t$, a regression component of continuous predictors $\mathbf{x}$ (e.g. $x_{t,1} = t$ is the linear trend over time) with coefficients $\beta_k$, and change-due-to-intervention $z_t$:
\begin{align*}
y_t & = \alpha_{d(t)} + \phi_1 y_{t - 1} + \phi_2 y_{t - 2} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t - 1} + \sum_{k = 1}^K \beta_k x_{t,k} + z_t + \epsilon_t;\\
z_t & = \omega_1 z_{t-1} + \delta_0 I_t = \frac{\delta_0 (1 - \omega_1^{(t - T + 1)})}{(1 - \omega_1)},
\end{align*}
where $T$ marks the deployment of the sitemaps, $I_t = 1$ for $t \geq T$ (and 0 otherwise) as before, and $d(t)$ is a pointer to the appropriate $\alpha_d$ for the $t$-th observation. In the model we have $\beta_2, \ldots, \beta_7$ to represent the effect of days of the week (relative to Sunday so as to avoid the [dummy variable trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)#Incorporating_a_dummy_independent)).

The underlying intervention effect of interest $\delta_0$ is inferred using [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference). The model's parameters had the following [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability):
\begin{align*}
  \phi_p, \theta_1 & \sim \text{Cauchy}(0, 1),~-1 \leq \phi_p, \theta_q \leq 1~\text{for}~p = 1, 2;\\
  \alpha_d & \sim \mathcal{N}(\gamma_{m(d)}, \sigma_{\alpha_{m(d)}}),~d = 1, \ldots, 365;\\
  \gamma_m & \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\gamma, \sigma_\gamma),~m = 1, \ldots, 12;\\
  \mu_\gamma, \beta_k & \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 10),~k = 0, \ldots, K;\\
  \epsilon & \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\epsilon);\\
  \delta_0 & \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \tau);\\
  \sigma_\epsilon, \sigma_{\alpha_m}, \sigma_\gamma, \tau & \sim \text{Cauchy}(0, 5);\\
  \omega_1 & \sim \text{Beta}(9, 3).
\end{align*}

Since $z_t$ can be expressed in terms of $\delta_0$ and $\omega_1$ ($|\omega_1| < 1$) as a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) (see above), we can also calculate the long-term boost-due-to-sitemaps: $\lim_{t \to \infty} z_t = \frac{\delta_0}{1 - \omega_1}$.
